# Contributing

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

You can use [Guard][] to automatically run the tests every time a file in the `lib` or `spec` folder changes.

Run Guard through Bundler with:

```shell
bundle exec guard
```

## Dependencies

Although this gem supports Ruby 2.0.0, in order to use the latest development dependencies you have to use at least Ruby 2.2.2.

If you wish to compile `.proto` definitions to Ruby, you will need to install [Google's Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf).

### OSX

```shell
brew install protobuf
```

### Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf
```

This gem relies heavily on the [Ruby Protobuf][] gem. For more information on how Google Protobuf works, please see the [Wiki pages][].

Compiling the common and attribute `.proto` definitions can be done with the following commands:

```shell
cd lib/yoti/protobuf/v1
protoc -I definitions/attribute-public-api/attrpubapi_v1 --ruby_out ./attribute_public_api definitions/attribute-public-api/attrpubapi_v1/*.proto
protoc -I definitions/common-public-api/compubapi_v1/ --ruby_out ./common_public_api definitions/common-public-api/compubapi_v1/*.proto
```

These commands will overwrite the current protobuf Ruby modules, which have been modified. If the protobuf files have to be updated, a good idea would be to change them manually, or generate the files in a new location, and compare the content.

## Requirements

### Code coverage

The 100% code coverage requirement must be met before submitting new code.
This can be checked by opening the generated [SimpleCov][] files:

 ```shell
open coverage/index.html
 ```

### Style guide

The Ruby style guide is configured in the [rubocop.yml](rubocop.yml) file and can be checked by running:

```shell
bundle exec rake rubocop
```

### Documentation

The documentation uses the [Yard][] format. Please ensure all new classes and methods are fully documented.

There are a few Rake tasks to handle documentation:

```shell
bundle exec rake measurement
```

Verifies the documentation with [Yardstick][] and generates the `measurement/report.txt` file, containing tips on how to improve the documentation coverage.

```shell
bundle exec rake yard
```

Generates [YARD][] documentation in the doc folder.
